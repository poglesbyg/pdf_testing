## Form Extraction Rules
Primary file: `pdf_parser.py`
Importance Score: 85/100

The HTSF form parser implements specialized extraction patterns for sequencing submission forms:

1. Sample Metadata Extraction
- Concentration values (ng/ÂµL range: 112.70 - 468.75)
- A260/280 ratios for quality assessment
- Sample volumes and buffer compositions
- Organism/tissue source information

2. Sequencing Parameters
- Nanopore flow cell requirements
- Coverage depth specifications
- Run time estimations based on sample complexity
- Amplicon length validation

3. Project Identification
- HTSF--XX-XXX format validation
- Cross-reference with existing projects
- Batch submission grouping rules

## Validation Framework
- Human DNA content detection and flagging
- Concentration threshold enforcement
- Required metadata completeness checks
- Sample quality metrics validation:
  * Minimum concentration thresholds
  * Acceptable A260/280 ratio ranges
  * Volume adequacy checks

## Domain-Specific Rules
- Automated flagging of samples outside accepted ranges
- Cross-validation of related sample parameters
- Project-specific validation rules based on submission type
- Custom duplicate detection incorporating:
  * Sample metadata comparison
  * Project code validation
  * Timestamp-based submission rules

## Quality Control Integration
- Sample concentration distribution analysis
- Automated outlier detection
- Quality metric tracking per project
- Validation against historical submission patterns
