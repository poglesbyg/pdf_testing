# pdf-parsing-algorithm

The HTSF form parsing algorithm implements specialized extraction and validation rules:

1. Metadata Extraction (Score: 85)
- Located in: `/pdf_parser.py`
- Extracts key fields from standardized form locations:
  - Project ID and timestamp for submission tracking
  - Owner information and contact details
  - Sample type classifications
  - Sequencing parameters and requirements

2. Sample Table Processing (Score: 90) 
- Located in: `/pdf_parser.py`
- Parses complex multi-row sample tables containing:
  - Sample identifiers
  - Concentration measurements
  - Buffer compositions
  - Quality metrics
- Validates data against required thresholds

3. Form Version Detection (Score: 75)
- Located in: `/pdf_parser.py`
- Identifies HTSF form version from structural markers
- Adapts extraction patterns based on form layout
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy formats

4. Data Validation Rules (Score: 80)
- Located in: `/pdf_parser.py`
- Enforces domain-specific constraints:
  - Required concentration ranges
  - Valid buffer compositions
  - Sample naming conventions
  - Project ID formatting

5. Laboratory Data Processing (Score: 85)
- Located in: `/pdf_parser.py`, `/database_manager.py`
- Extracts specialized laboratory measurements:
  - DNA/RNA quality scores
  - Purity ratios
  - Contaminant levels
- Maps values to standardized units

6. Error Recovery (Score: 70)
- Located in: `/pdf_parser.py`
- Handles common form completion errors:
  - Missing optional fields
  - Malformed measurements
  - Inconsistent formatting
- Generates warning flags for manual review

The parser maintains strict validation while accommodating variations in form completion patterns commonly seen in laboratory environments. The extraction rules are optimized for the specific structure and content requirements of HTSF Nanopore submission forms.
