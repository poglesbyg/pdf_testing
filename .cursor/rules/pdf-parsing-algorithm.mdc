## Form Extraction Patterns

The PDF parser implements specialized extraction logic for HTSF (High-Throughput Sequencing Facility) submission forms:

1. Sample Data Extraction
- Concentration measurements (ng/ÂµL)
- A260/280 purity ratios  
- Volume specifications
- Sample type classification (gDNA, cDNA, PCR Amplicons)

2. Project Metadata 
- HTSF project identifiers (HTSF--XX-###)
- Sequencing type (Ligation, Rapid, Barcoding)
- Organism/tissue information

## Validation Rules

Laboratory-specific validation enforces:

1. Sample Quality Requirements
- DNA concentration ranges per sequencing type
- Minimum purity ratio thresholds
- Required volume validations

2. Project Metadata Validation  
- Project ID format compliance
- Required fields for genomic processing
- Sample naming convention checks

## Business Domain Integration

The parser connects to laboratory workflows by:

1. Generating standardized submission IDs:
`HTSF[Owner Initials][Project Number]_[Date]_[Time]`

2. Supporting lab-specific metadata:
- Sample classifications
- Project references
- Quality metrics

Importance Score: 85/100
