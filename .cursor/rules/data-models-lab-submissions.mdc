## Core Data Models

### Sample Submission Model
Importance Score: 95/100

- Sample metadata tracking:
  - Concentration measurements (ng/µL) with validation ranges 112.70-468.75
  - Quality ratios (A260/280)
  - Volume requirements
  - Project identifiers in HTSF--XX-XXX format

### Project Relationship Model 
Importance Score: 85/100

- Links submissions to projects:
  - Unique submission ID generation (HTSFJL147_20250910_113759)
  - Project code validation
  - Sample batch associations
  - Cross-project sample tracking

### Quality Control Model
Importance Score: 80/100

- Tracks quality metrics:
  - Concentration thresholds
  - Human DNA contamination flags
  - Amplicon length verification
  - Required metadata completeness

### Sample Statistics Model
Importance Score: 75/100

- Analyzes submission patterns:
  - Sample concentration distributions
  - Project-wise submission trends
  - Quality control metric aggregation
  - Batch validation results

Key Validation Rules:
- Sample count limits per submission
- Concentration range validation (112.70-468.75 ng/µL)
- Project code format (HTSF--XX-XXX)
- Required metadata fields for HTSF submissions
- Duplicate sample detection across projects

Relevant Files:
- database_manager.py
- track_submissions.py
- sqlite_tracker.py
