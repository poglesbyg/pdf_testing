Laboratory submission data models define the core structure for handling genomic sequencing requests and sample tracking.

Key Data Models:

1. Sample Submission Model
- Project identifier (HTSF--XX-###)
- Sample concentrations (ng/ÂµL)
- A260/280 purity ratios
- Volume measurements
- Sample type classification
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Project Metadata Model
- Sequencing type (Ligation/Rapid/Barcoding)
- Sample type (gDNA/Fragmented DNA/PCR/cDNA)
- Organism/tissue information
- Project relationships
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Laboratory Measurement Model
- Nanodrop concentration readings
- Statistical aggregates per submission
- Quality control thresholds
- Volume tracking
Importance Score: 80/100

Data Validation Rules:
- Sample concentrations must fall within sequencing-type specific ranges
- Project IDs follow strict HTSF naming convention
- Required metadata fields vary by sample type
- Duplicate submissions prevented via file hashing
- Sample measurements must include concentration and purity ratios

File Paths:
/database_manager.py - Sample and measurement data persistence
/track_submissions.py - Submission workflow and relationship tracking
/pdf_parser.py - Form data extraction and validation

Domain-Specific Features:
- Specialized data structures for genomic sequencing workflows
- Laboratory measurement tracking with quality thresholds
- Project-sample relationship management
- Submission status tracking through laboratory pipeline

Overall Model Importance Score: 90/100
