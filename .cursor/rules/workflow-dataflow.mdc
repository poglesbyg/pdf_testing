# workflow-dataflow

The data workflow follows a specialized path for High-Throughput Sequencing Facility (HTSF) form processing:

## Form Submission Flow (Importance: 90/100)
1. PDF Form Ingestion (`pdf_parser.py`)
   - Parses HTSF Nanopore submission forms
   - Extracts domain-specific metadata:
     - Sample concentrations
     - Sequencing parameters
     - Project identifiers
   - Applies HTSF-specific validation rules

2. Data Validation (`api_server.py`)
   - Validates sample metadata completeness
   - Verifies project code format (HTSF--XX-XXX)
   - Checks concentration thresholds
   - Flags human DNA content
   - Validates amplicon lengths

## Storage and Tracking Flow (Importance: 85/100)
1. Database Processing (`database_manager.py`)
   - Generates unique submission IDs
   - Detects duplicate submissions via file hashing
   - Tracks sample batches
   - Manages project-specific metadata

2. Submission Tracking (`sqlite_tracker.py`, `track_submissions.py`)
   - Records submission status
   - Maintains project-wise submission patterns
   - Tracks quality control metrics
   - Monitors sample concentration distributions

## Key Data Transformations
1. Sample Data Processing
   - Concentration validation (112.70 - 468.75 ng/ÂµL)
   - A260/280 ratio calculations
   - Nanodrop concentration verification
   - Sample quality assessment

2. Project Management
   - Project code validation
   - Sample batch organization
   - Submission status tracking
   - Quality metrics aggregation
