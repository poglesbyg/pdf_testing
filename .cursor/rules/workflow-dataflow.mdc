# workflow-dataflow

## Submission Data Flow
1. PDF Form Intake -> Parser
- Submission forms contain HTSF-specific laboratory data
- PDF parser extracts structured sample metadata and measurements
- Validates domain requirements for sequencing projects
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Data Processing Pipeline
- Extracts concentration measurements (ng/ÂµL) and quality ratios
- Applies HTSF laboratory validation rules
- Generates unique submission IDs: HTSF[Owner][Project]_[Date]_[Time]
Importance Score: 80/100

3. Database Storage Flow
/database_manager.py -> /sqlite_tracker.py
- Records sample measurements and metadata
- Tracks laboratory workflow status
- Maintains submission history with concentration statistics
- Implements duplicate detection using file hashing
Importance Score: 75/100

## Data Model Relationships
- Projects contain multiple samples with sequencing requirements
- Samples tracked by measurements, concentrations, and purity ratios
- Submissions linked to workflow states and project metadata
Importance Score: 70/100

## Laboratory Data Validation
- Enforces concentration ranges for DNA/RNA samples
- Validates A260/280 purity ratios
- Ensures complete metadata for genomic sequencing
- Applies naming conventions for laboratory submissions
Importance Score: 82/100
