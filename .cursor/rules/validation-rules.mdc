# validation-rules

Core Sample Validation Rules:

1. Concentration Validation
- Acceptable DNA/RNA concentration ranges: 
  * gDNA: 1-1000 ng/µL
  * Fragmented DNA: 0.1-100 ng/µL
  * PCR Amplicons: 0.5-50 ng/µL
  * cDNA: 0.2-200 ng/µL

2. Quality Ratio Checks
- A260/280 ratio requirements:
  * DNA samples: 1.8-2.0
  * RNA samples: 1.8-2.2
- A260/230 ratio minimum: > 1.5

3. Laboratory Naming Conventions
- Project IDs: HTSF-[XX]-[###]
  * XX: Owner initials (2 characters)
  * ###: Sequential number (3 digits)
- Sample IDs: [Project ID]_S[##]
  * ##: Sample number (2 digits)

4. Volume Requirements
- Minimum volume: 20 µL
- Maximum volume: 100 µL
- Required volume varies by sequencing type:
  * Ligation: 50 µL
  * Rapid: 30 µL
  * Barcoding: 40 µL

5. Metadata Validation
- Required fields:
  * Organism name
  * Sample type
  * Preparation method
  * Storage conditions
- Optional fields with conditional requirements:
  * Fragment size (required for fragmented DNA)
  * PCR cycles (required for amplicons)
  * RIN score (required for RNA)

Importance Score: 90/100
Rationale: Critical for ensuring sample quality and maintaining laboratory standards
