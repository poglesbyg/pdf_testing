# validation-rules

Key validation rules for HTSF (High-Throughput Sequencing Facility) sample processing:

## Sample Concentration Validation
Importance Score: 95/100

- Valid concentration range: 112.70 - 468.75 ng/µL
- Automated flagging system for out-of-range samples
- Statistical analysis for quality control thresholds

## Project Identifier Rules
Importance Score: 85/100

Format requirements:
- Pattern: HTSF--XX-XXX
- Submission ID format: HTSF{ProjectCode}_{Date}_{Time}
- Example: HTSFJL147_20250910_113759

## Metadata Validation
Importance Score: 90/100

Required fields:
- Sample concentration measurements (ng/µL)
- A260/280 ratios
- Organism and tissue information
- Sequencing parameters
- Flow cell requirements

## Quality Control Metrics
Importance Score: 88/100

Automated validation for:
- Human DNA content presence
- Amplicon length verification
- Nanodrop concentration measurements
- Sample batch consistency
- Project-specific sample count limits

## Duplicate Detection
Importance Score: 75/100

Validation against:
- File content hashing
- Project ID matching
- Sample count verification
- Concentration data comparison
- Timestamp-based validation

Implemented in:
- pdf_parser.py
- api_server.py
- database_manager.py
